    "\n",
    "The Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company. They desire better to understand the\n",
    "customer behavior to create new marketing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do that, the company provide their dataset to a data analyst team\n",
    "analyze and come up with data insights. Then, the executive team will inspect\n",
    "the results and further make data-driven decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cyclistic has more thousands of bikes divided in different categories such\n",
    "as classic, reclining, electric. There are two types of customers, the ones with\n",
    "annual membership and the one with a pass (single-ride or full-day).\n",

    "## **Ask**\n",
    "In this phase, we define the problem and the stakeholders.\n",

    "### Business task\n",
    "The business task is to determine how different the customers use the company's\n",
    "bikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "The stakeholders are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Primary: director of marketing\n",
    "  * Secondary: marketing analytics team\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",

    "## **Prepare**\n",
    "Now, the focus is to collect, store, and evaluate the datasets\n",

    "### Information about the dataset\n",
    "Regarding the dataset, we have the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It is external data stored in the [cloud](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)\n",
    "  * It used the long data format\n",
    "  * First-party data (reliable and original)\n",
    "  * There is a file for each past 12 months (current)\n",
    "  * It is distributed under a [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)\n",
    "  * There is not Personally Identifiable Information (PII)\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Data acquisition process\n",
    "The following process is utilized:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Each dataset is downloaded\n",
    "  * Appropriately stored in a folder for original datasets\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Identifying issues\n",
    "In order to identify issues with the data, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Evaluate the ride length and spot unusual observations\n",
    "  * Filtered the data and identified missing values\n",
    "  * Sorted the data and found inconsistent attribute format\n",

    "### Tools\n",
    "We selected tools to perform specific tools, as described next.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Spreadsheets: perform initial data inspection\n",
    "  * R: develop scripts to clean, transform, organize, and summarize the datasets\n",
